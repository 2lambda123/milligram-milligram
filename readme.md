## Why it's awesome

Milligram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting point. Just it! **Only 2kb gzipped!** It's not about a UI framework. Specially designed for better performance and higher productivity with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code. Hope you enjoy!


Key Features and Characteristics:

Minimalist: Milligram is intentionally minimalistic, providing only a small set of essential styles and components. It follows the "less is more" philosophy, allowing developers to add styles as needed.

CSS Reset: It includes a CSS reset to normalize styles across different browsers, ensuring a consistent starting point for web development.

Typography: Milligram provides a typographic baseline with sensible defaults for headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.

Responsive: While lightweight, Milligram is designed to be responsive, so it works well on various screen sizes and devices.

Customization: Developers can easily customize and extend Milligram according to their project requirements, as it doesn't impose a strict design or structure.

Open Source: Milligram is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, which means it is actively maintained and contributions from the community are welcome.

To use Milligram in a web project, you can either include the Milligram CSS file directly in your HTML or use a package manager like npm to install and manage it.
